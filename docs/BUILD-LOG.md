# InternNest — Build Log

A running record of what's being built and why. More detailed than the Owner's Guide,
but kept readable. Newest entries at the bottom.

---

## 2026-06-28 — Foundation

- Created private GitHub repo `jackryan225/internpilot-ai` (to be renamed `internnest`)
  and pushed the existing 3-file static site (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`).
  Added `README.md` as a quick edit guide. Invited Dillon (`dillonsilvers1234`) as a collaborator.
- Verified the local copy was byte-identical to the live Netlify site before pushing.
- Linked the repo to the existing Netlify site for **continuous deploy** (push to `main`
  → live in ~30s). Build command: none. Publish dir: repo root (it's a static site).

## 2026-06-29 — Domain

- Dillon purchased **internnest.ai** (GoDaddy; `.ai`, ~$70–100/yr — to be held in Dillon's name).
- Pointed it at Netlify via **Netlify DNS**: set GoDaddy's nameservers to Netlify's four
  (`dns1–4.p06.nsone.net`), added the domain in Netlify (primary = internnest.ai, www → redirect).
- Status: nameservers propagated to Netlify; Netlify serving the site at the origin;
  waiting on the old cached DNS to expire + Netlify to auto-issue the Let's Encrypt SSL cert.

## Decisions locked (brainstorm)

- **Hosting:** stay on Netlify (static + serverless functions + SSL + auto-deploy — covers everything v1 needs).
- **Design freeze (Dillon's rule):** do NOT change the front-end design or structure unless
  it's actively glitchy. Allowed: the rebrand (logo + name) and bug fixes only.
- **Rebrand:** InternPilot AI → **InternNest** (logo provided by Dillon; same layout/structure).
- **AI matcher (core deliverable):** real "Find My Matches" engine. A real internship dataset
  (`internships.json`, built via an agentic research sweep, each entry with a verified application
  URL) + a Netlify serverless function that pre-filters by industry/location, then calls the AI to
  score/explain the shortlist. Provider TBD (Claude Haiku vs Gemini Flash).
- **Chat advisor:** secondary; trim-first if budget tightens.
- **Payments:** Stripe (account created in Dillon's name). Stripe-hosted checkout + a lightweight
  unlock **verified server-side** against the Stripe session (so the success URL can't be faked).
  $9.99 one-time "Unlock Premium" + $29 "Match Report" (printable → Save as PDF). Real
  accounts/subscriptions deferred to a later phase.
- **Free vs Premium:** Free = top 3 matches + one-line why. Premium = all ~10 matches, full
  reasoning + skill gaps, AI outreach messages, chat advisor, resume tips.

## Engagement

- Fixed fee **$1,600** this round (basic-but-real AI + full MVP); more depending on performance.
  Jack = contractor for Dillon. Full handoff: ownership transfer of all accounts + maintenance
  lessons + the Owner's Guide.
